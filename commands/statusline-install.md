description: Install the cross-platform status line into your Claude Code user settings

Install the `claude-statusline` status line for the current user.

Do this yourself with tools — do not just print instructions.

1. Determine the platform.
   - Windows: use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline.ps1`
   - macOS / Linux / WSL: use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline.sh`

2. Copy that script to the user's `~/.claude/` directory, keeping the same
   filename. Create `~/.claude/` first if it does not exist. On Unix, `chmod +x`
   the copied file.

   Copy the matching mascot hook alongside it — `scripts/mascot-hook.ps1` on
   Windows, `scripts/mascot-hook.sh` elsewhere — plus the short wrapper
   (`scripts/mascot.cmd` on Windows, `scripts/mascot` elsewhere), unless the
   user asked to skip the mascot.

3. Read `~/.claude/settings.json` if it exists. Preserve every existing key —
   only add or replace the `statusLine` key. If the file does not exist, create
   it with `{}` as the starting point. Back up the original to
   `~/.claude/settings.json.bak` before writing.

   The value to set, with `<HOME>` replaced by the real home directory and all
   Windows path separators written as `/`:

   Windows:
   ```json
   "statusLine": {
     "type": "command",
     "command": "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <HOME>/.claude/statusline.ps1",
     "refreshInterval": 2
   }
   ```

   macOS / Linux:
   ```json
   "statusLine": {
     "type": "command",
     "command": "sh \"<HOME>/.claude/statusline.sh\"",
     "refreshInterval": 2
   }
   ```

   Unless the user asked to skip the mascot, also register the three hooks that
   tell the status line what the turn is doing. Merge them into `hooks`, keeping
   every hook that is already there and replacing only a previous `mascot-hook`
   entry, so running this twice never stacks duplicates:

   Windows (`<CMD>` = `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <HOME>/.claude/mascot-hook.ps1 -State`):
   macOS / Linux (`<CMD>` = `sh "<HOME>/.claude/mascot-hook.sh"`):

   ```json
   "hooks": {
     "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "<CMD> working" }] }],
     "Stop":             [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "<CMD> done" }] }],
     "StopFailure":      [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "<CMD> error" }] }],
     "Notification":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "<CMD> notify" }] }]
   }
   ```

   Write the file as UTF-8 **without** a BOM — a BOM makes the settings file
   unparseable.

4. Verify by piping a mock payload into the installed script and confirming it
   prints exactly one line:

   ```json
   {"workspace":{"current_dir":"/tmp"},"model":{"display_name":"Opus 5"},"context_window":{"used_percentage":42},"rate_limits":{"five_hour":{"used_percentage":63}}}
   ```

5. Report the installed path, the `statusLine` block that was written, and the
   test output. Tell the user to restart Claude Code or open a new session, and
   that the mascot appears only after `/statusline-roll` — it is not rolled
   automatically. With this plugin installed on a recent Claude Code the mascot
   sits under the prompt on the right and legends shimmer there; the status
   line then leaves its own copy out. `/statusline-place right|left|above|line`
   moves it (`line` puts it back at the end of the status line).
